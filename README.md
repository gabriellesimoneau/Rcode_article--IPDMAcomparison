# Rcode_article--IPDMAcomparison
R code and support for article "A comparison of methods to meta-analyze individual patient data of diagnostic accuracy"

As the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) individual patient dataset can not be publish, we provide an example dataset (simulated\_dataset.csv) that mimics the PHQ-9 IPD dataset to reproduce the data analysis in the article. Results using that example dataset can be found in Resultsexampledataset.csv. The corresponding R Sweave file is also available here (Results\_example\_dataset.Rnw)
